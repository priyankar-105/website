    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Priyankar Samanta</strong>, currently pursuing my <strong>M.Sc. in Statistics</strong> at the <strong>University of Calcutta</strong>.</p>
    <p>I completed my <strong>B.Sc. in Statistics</strong> from <strong>Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (RKMRC), Narendrapur</strong>, where I developed a solid foundation in statistical theory and application.</p>
    <p>My core interest lies in applying statistical tools and techniques to real-life problems and uncovering meaningful insights from data. I have worked on various academic projects involving hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and multiple linear regression using tools like R and Excel.</p>
    <p>Some of my work includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>COVID-19 Data Analysis</strong> â€“ built predictive models to study the effects of age and gender on fatality using statistical tests and logistic regression.</li>
        <li><strong>Spotify Data Analysis</strong> â€“ analyzed track features to predict popularity using regression techniques and diagnostic tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Estimation Techniques</strong> â€“ compared randomized and non-randomized survey methods during my B.Sc. final project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also interned as a <strong>Data Science Intern</strong> at Prodigy Infotech, performing EDA and sentiment analysis on datasets like Titanic and social media data.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m proficient in <strong>R programming</strong>, and familiar with tools like Excel, LaTeX, and PowerPoint. I enjoy solving analytical problems and visualizing data in meaningful ways.</p>
    <p>In 2025, I secured an <strong>All India Rank (AIR) of 104</strong> in the GATE Statistics exam. I'm also a recipient of the <strong>INSPIRE Scholarship</strong> awarded by the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India.</p>
